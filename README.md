print-manager
===========

Print Manager is a desktop utility which identifies and connects 3D printers and converts files for delivery to a particular model of 3D printer. The utility is used by Print Studio.

On supported 3D printers, Print Manager converts a set of native 3D printer commands into a format recognized by the supported printer models, allowing a "printable" file to be sent to a specific printer model.

If you are a printer manufacturer interested in integrating your printer with Print Manager then see [this guide](https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/reference/printer-manufacturers/integrate-your-printer/integrate-your-printer-model).

For Print Manager to start you must download the geometry processor that is attached to the releases see [Print Manager Releases](https://github.com/spark3dp/print-manager/releases)

When unzipped please edit the localConfig.json file to use this.


## Quick Install Node.js  

   To install on Debian 8 with OctoPrint:
   
  Step 1 - Update your system
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install git-core curl build-essential openssl libssl-dev
  ```
  Step 2 - Install Node.js
   First, clone the Node.js repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
  cd node
  ```
  Now, select the specific version of Node needed by Print Manager:
  ```
  git tag # Gives you a list of released versions
  git checkout v0.11.16
  ```
  Then compile and install Node like this:
  ```
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  ```
  Then, check if node was installed correctly:
  ```
  node -v
  ```
  Step 3 - Install NPM
   Simply run the NPM install script:
  ```
  curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
  ```
  And then check it works:
  ```
  npm -v
  ```
  Thatâ€™s all.
  
  If npm is giving you problems, this is my current fix:
  ```
  npm install -g n
  npm install npm -g
  ```

1. CD spark-print-mgr 
2. Add localConfig.json to the spark-print-mgr directory with the following content (it contains the location to the prep server)

{
         "roopaServerPath" : "C:/SPARK/Release/runTime/RoopaServer.app/Contents/MacOS/RoopaServer"
}

   The above will work for Mac OS*.

3. node Server.js (will start server on localhost:9998)  
4. Go to: http://localhost:9998/printdb/printertypes to see normal execution

If you see any issues please use the github issue mechanism. 
 
If you are building on Windows, install Bonjour SDK from the Apple Store and make sure the variable  BONJOUR_SDK_HOME is set to the location.   

*Here is an example of localConfig.json for Windows. 

{
         "roopaServerPath" : "C:\\\Users\\\joe\\\Release\\\runTime\\\bin\\\RoopaServer.exe",
}
